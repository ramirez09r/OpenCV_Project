Please excuse the findScore being somewhat messy, I know it can be cleaned up, but I haven't had a chance. 


These 2 files contain an application prototyoe tha is pretty much ready for presentation, we just need to integrate the tkinter portion that some of you have with it. 
On the findScore.py file you will find the app() and app_webcam() functions which are linked to their respective buttons and are called by tkinter on the app.py file.


These files can be used for our presentation coming up, but I will work on cleaning up the functions for further presentations. As you will see the webcam and pre-recorded functions work differently due to the masking of the frames. I am currently working on a possible solution for this, but it probably won't be ready for our first presentation, however I think we are good to go as far as 1st prototype. 

I commented my code as much as I could, but let me know if you have any questions.
